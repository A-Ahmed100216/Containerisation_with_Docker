# Containerisation with Docker

## What is a Container?
* A standardised unit of software.
* Packages code and all its dependencies so applications can run quickly and reliably from one environment to another.
* Container images are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software.
* They include everything needed to run an app (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings).

* Images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.
* Such containers are:
  * Standard - Portable anywhere
  * Lightweight - share machine OS therefore do no need their own OS. This lead to higher efficiency and reduced server and license costs.
  * Secure - 'Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry' [*source*](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
